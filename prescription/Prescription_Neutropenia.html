		<td>Aflibercept</td>
		<td>Approved</td>
		<td>The opthalmic agent is used for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related mascular degeneration (AMD) and macular edema following central retinal vein occulsion (CRVO). The systemic injection, known as ziv-aflibercept, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan-(FOLFIRI), is for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or progressed following treatment with oxaliplatin. </td>

		<td>4.</td>
		<td>Deferiprone</td>
		<td>Approved</td>
		<td>Deferiprone is indicated in thalassemia syndromes when first line chelation agents are not adequate to treat transfusional iron overload.</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>5.</td>
		<td>Rolitetracycline</td>
		<td>Approved</td>
		<td>Rolitetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in cases needing high concentrations or when oral administration is impractical.</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>6.</td>
		<td>Pertuzumab</td>
		<td>Approved</td>

	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>7.</td>
		<td>Filgrastim</td>
		<td>Approved</td>
		<td>Filgrastim is used in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy. It is also used in cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplant. In general, filgrastim increases neutrophil counts in order to decrease the risk of infection or duration of neutropenia in the aforementioned patient populations. Infection and neutropenia are adverse events associated with chemotherapy. Furthermore, filgrastim is also indicated for patients with severe chronic neutropenia. It mobilizes hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis to allow for a more rapid engraftment. Tbo-filgrastim has a narrower indication profile than Neupogen - it is a leukocyte growth factor indicated for the reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies.</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>8.</td>
		<td>Pegfilgrastim</td>
		<td>Approved</td>
		<td>Increases leukocyte production, for treatment in non-myeloid cancer, neutropenia and bone marrow transplant.</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>9.</td>
		<td>Cyclophosphamide</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>Cyclophosphamide is indicated for the treatment of malignant lymphomas, multiple myeloma, leukemias, mycosis fungoides (advanced disease), neuroblastoma (disseminated disease), adenocarcinoma of the ovary, retinoblastoma, and carcinoma of the breast. It is also indicated for the treatment of biopsy-proven minimal change nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients. </td>

		<td>For use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for total parenteral nutrition (TPN).</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>11.</td>
		<td>Cladribine</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>For the treatment of active hairy cell leukemia (leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) as defined by clinically significant anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or disease-related symptoms. Also used as an alternative agent for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>12.</td>
		<td>Olaratumab</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>Olaratumab is indicated, in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or mestastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery.</td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>13.</td>
		<td>Obinutuzumab</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>Obinutuzumab is used as a combination treatment with chlorambucil to treat patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</td>

		<td>15.</td>
		<td>Rolapitant</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>

		<td>16.</td>
		<td>Uridine triacetate</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>Marketed as the product Xuriden (FDA), uridine triacetate is indicated for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria.Marketed as the product Vistogard (FDA), uridine triacetate is indicated for the emergency treatment of adult and pediatric patients in the following situations: following a fluorouracil or capecitabine overdose regardless of the presence of symptoms; or who exhibit early-onset, severe or life-threatening toxicity affecting the cardiac or central nervous system, and/or early-onset, unusually severe adverse reactions (e.g., gastrointestinal toxicity and/or neutropenia) within 96 hours following the end of fluorouracil or capecitabine administration. </td>
	</tr>	<tr>
		<td>17.</td>
		<td>Tofacitinib</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>For the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis which is resistant or intolerant to methotrexate therapy. It may also be used as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), when methotrexate alone is not sufficient. Tofacitinib has also been investigated as a preventative therapy for kidney transplant rejections, and as a treatment for psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It is not to be initiated in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infections, or in the presence of active infection, even if localized, due to reports of serious and sometimes fatal infections (commonly pneumonia, herpes zoster and urinary tract infections). Use of tofacitinib is also discouraged in those who have been, or are likely to be, exposed to TB. An increased likelihood of exposure may be encountered by traveling to certain areas. In addition, tofacitinib is not to be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment, or low hemoglobin (less than 9g/dL). Cautioned is advised when using tofacitinib in patients at risk of gastrointestinal perforation, and in the elderly who are more susceptible to infection. </td>

		<td>Lenograstim</td>
		<td>Approved, Investigational</td>
		<td>The drug is used to reduce the risk of life-threatening infection in patients with neutropenia, particularly after cytotoxic chemotherapy.Lenograstim is indicated as a treatment to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the severity of infections in patients with non-myeloid malignancy who have undergone autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or treatment with established cytotoxic chemotherapy and in addition to reduce the incidence of infection associated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy.Lenograstim is also indicated to mobilise peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) with Lenograstim alone, or after myelosuppressive chemotherapy, in order to accelerate haematopoietic recovery by infusion of such cells, after myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy. Lenograstim is also indicated to accelerate the engraftment of these cells after their reinfusion.GRANOCYTE is also indicated for the treatment of severe chronic neutropenia including congenital agranulocytosis (Kostmann's syndrome).</td>
