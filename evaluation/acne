Symptoms :
If you have acne, you will typically notice pimples that are white or black in appearance. Whiteheads and blackheads are the most common lesions seen in acne
Inflammatory lesions are more likely to cause scarring of your skin:
    1. Papules are small red, raised bumps caused by inflamed or infected hair follicles.
    2. Pustules are small red pimples that have pus at their tips.
    3. Nodules are solid, often painful lumps beneath the surface of your skin.
    4. Cysts are large lumps found beneath your skin that contain pus and are usually painful.

Medication :
    1. Benzoyl peroxide is present in many acne creams and gels. It’s used for drying out existing pimples and preventing new ones.
    2. Benzoyl peroxide also kills acne-causing bacteria.
    3. Sulfur is a natural ingredient with a distinctive smell that’s found in some lotions, cleansers, and masks.
    4. Resorcinol is a less common ingredient that’s used to remove dead skin cells.
    5. Salicylic acid is often contained in soaps and acne washes. It helps prevent pores from getting plugged.
    6. Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a vitamin-A-based medication that’s used to treat certain cases of severe nodular acne. It can cause serious side effects, and it’s only used when other treatments have failed.
