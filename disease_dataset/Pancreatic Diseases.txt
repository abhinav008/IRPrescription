1. Name:  WF10
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  WF10 is a chlorite-based, immunomodulating drug is developed by Nuvo Research Inc. Certain preclinical evidence and clinical pilot data suggest that WF10 may be effective in treating certain cancers. The Corporation believes the research to-date demonstrates that WF10 acts on macrophages (a type of white blood cell) by modulating the balance between inflammation and phagocytosis, a state in which the body digests foreign, potentially harmful substances. The Corporation has commenced a Phase II clinical trial in an effort to demonstrate the efficacy of WF10 in combination with Xeloda (capecitabine) in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The trial is being conducted in Germany at the University of Heidelberg and the National Centre for Tumor Diseases.

1. Name:  Bentiromide
2. Groups:  Investigational, Withdrawn
3. Description:  Bentiromide is a peptide used as a screening test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and to monitor the adequacy of supplemental pancreatic therapy. It is given by mouth as a noninvasive test. The amount of 4-aminobenzoic acid and its metabolites excreted in the urine is taken as a measure of the chymotrypsin-secreting activity of the pancreas. Headache and gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported in patients taking bentiromide. Bentiromide is not available in the U.S. or Canada (It was withdrawn in the US in October 1996).
4. Indication:  Used as a screening test for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and to monitor the adequacy of supplemental pancreatic therapy.
DrugId:  12
1. Name:  TM30339
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  TM30339 is an analogue of the natural hormone Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), which is released in connection with meals. TM30339 works through the same receptor as the natural satiety hormone, Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), but TM30339 has improved properties compared with PP. TM30339 thus imitates a natural mechanism, a satiety signal from the gastrointestinal system involved in the regulation of food intake in humans. TM30339 is developed for the treatment of obesity.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders.
