1. Name:  Desmoteplase
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  Desmoteplase is a chemical in the saliva of vampire bats. It activates plasminogen to the serine protease, plasmin. Plasmin acts by breaking down fibrin blood clots. When a vampire bat bites its victim, it secretes an enzyme that prevents the blood from clotting. The enzyme is called DSPA (Desmodus rotundus salivary plasminogen activator) and scientists are using DSPA as stroke and heart attack medication. Desmoteplase is a recombinant form of vampire bat DSPA (Salivary plasminogen activator alpha 1).
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in cerebral ischemia and strokes.

1. Name:  Von Willebrand Factor Human
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that consists of disulfide-bridge linked dimers. It is usually circulating in plasma as a stable complex with the coagulation factor VIII. The human vWF, as a drug product, is a complex that also contains the coagulation factor VIII.[1] This complex was developed by Octapharma Pharmazeutika Produktionsges and FDA approved on August 21, 2015.[8]
4. Indication:  The vWF and Factor VIII complex is indicated for the prevention of excessive bleeding during and after minor and major surgery in adult and pediatric von Willebrand disease patients. It is also indicated for the on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes.[9] The von Willebrand disease is an inherited disorder characterized by the deficiency or misfunction of the von Willebrand factor (vWF). Due to this deficiency, the blood cannot clot properly and the patients that present this disease are prone to prolonged or excessive bleeding. There are three types of this disease, and type 3 is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder marked by very low or absent levels of vWF.[10]

1. Name:  Human calcitonin
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Calcitonin was first discovered in isolated parathyroid tissue as a substance with a serum-calcium-lowering effect.[2] It is constituted as a 32-amino acid single chain polypeptide structure that gets secreted as a regulatory agent in calcium-phosphorus metabolism.[1] It is used as an alternative for people developing antibodies against salmon calcitonin.[3]
4. Indication:  Human calcitonin is indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease in the cases where the use of salmon calcitonin may provoke the generation of high-titer of antibodies.[3] Paget's disease is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased and disorganized bone turnover coupled with an increased bone formation. The majority of the cases are asymptomatic but some clinical manifestations include pain, bone deformity and some complications such as pathological fractures and deafness.[4] The increased activity in bone is associated with a rise in serum level of alkaline phosphatase and the increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline which is a product of bone breakdown.[2]

1. Name:  Factor XIII (human)
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Factor XIII (human) is a heat-treated, lyophilized concentrate of coagulation factor XIII, an endogenous enzyme responsible for the crosslinking of fibrin and an essential component of the coagulation cascade [FDA Label]. For people with congenital deficiency or mutation of Factor XIII, a rare bleeding disorder, exogenous replacement of this key coagulation factor is essential for management and prevention of bleeding episodes. Also known as Fibrin Stabilizing Factor (FSF), Factor XIII is an endogenously produced coagulation factor and the final enzyme within the blood coagulation cascade. Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 A-subunits and 2 B-subunits (A2B2)[2]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [1].Other drug products with similar structure and function to Factor XIII (human) include Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), which is a recombinant form of the A subunit of human coagulation factor XIII. Compared to Factor XIII (human), which is purified from pooled human plasma, Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) is produced through recombinant DNA technology where the target protein is grown in yeast and then isolated [FDA Label].Factor XIII (Human), available as the commercially available product Corifact, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for routine prophylactic treatment and peri-operative management of surgical bleeding in adult and pediatric patients with congenital FXIII deficiency [FDA Label]. As the half-life of endogenous Factor XIII is long (5-11 days), prophylactic therapy with the replacement of FXIII can be given every 4-6 to maintain hemostasis[2].
4. Indication:  Factor XIII (Human), available as the commercially available product Corifact, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for routine prophylactic treatment and peri-operative management of surgical bleeding in adult and pediatric patients with congenital FXIII deficiency [FDA Label].

1. Name:  Rotavirus Vaccine
2. Groups:  Approved

Two rotavirus vaccines are available for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis, Rotateq and Rotarix. Rotateq is a live vaccine consisting of 5 reassorted human-bovine viral strains [1]. Rotarix is a live attenuated vaccine containing the 89-12 human strain [FDA Label]. Rotavirus vaccines are 90% effective in protecting against severe rotavirus infection [2].
4. Indication:  Rotarix is indicated for prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G3, G4, and G9 types in infants aged 6-24 weeks [FDA Label].Rotateq is indicated for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9 types in infants aged 6-32 weeks [1].

1. Name:  Human Thrombin
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Human Thrombin is a sterile solution, pH 6.8-7.2, containing highly purified human thrombin for the activation of clotting. Thrombin is a highly specific serine protease encoded by the F2 gene that transforms soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. This transformation mimics the final coagulation cascade step which involves the clotting mass that adheres to the wound surface and achieves hemostasis and sealing of open tissues.In particular, while human thrombin products are made from pooled human source plasma, recombinant thrombin is a human coagulation protein produced via recombinant DNA technology from a genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary cell line [FDA Label].
4. Indication:  Human thrombin is indicated as an aid to hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules are accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, or cautery) is ineffective or impractical [FDA Label].

1. Name:  Insulin Human
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Insulin human is a 51 residue peptide hormone, composed of two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. The structure is identical to native human insulin. Recombinant insulin is synthesized by recombinant DNA techncology. Inserting the human insulin gene into the Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces insulin for human use.Inhalable insulin is a powdered form of insulin regular, delivered with a nebulizer into the lungs where it is absorbed. Exubera, developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics), became the first inhaled insulin product to be marketed in 2006 by Pfizer, but poor sales led Pfizer to withdraw it in 2007. Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind, was approved by the FDA in 2014.
4. Indication:  Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
