3. Description:  Docusate, or dioctyl sulfosuccinate, is a stool softener used for the treatment of constipation and stimulation of bowel movement. It works by increasing the amount of water the stool absorbs in the gut, making the stool softer and easier to pass [3]. Docusate exhibits little intrinsic stimulatory actions at recommended doses [4]. Its sodium salt form dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate commonly being the active ingredient, docusate can be orally or rectally administered. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. However the effectiveness of docusate in treating constipation remains unclear, as several studies report docusate to be no more effective than placebo for increasing the frequency of stool or stool softening [2]. Additionally, it does not appear to lessen symptoms associated with constipation such as abdominal cramps. Still decussate is available in over-the-counter products as one of common laxatives.
4. Indication:  Indicated for the treatment of constipation associated with dry, hard stools and decreased intestinal motility. Indicated for the prevention of occasional constipation or opioid-induced constipation.
