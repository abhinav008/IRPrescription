3. Description:  Borage oil, or borage seed oil, is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) that is obtained from the seeds of the Borago officinalis (borage). Borage oil is used as an herbal treatment of skin disorders including eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, and neurodermatitis as well as other inflammatory, cardiovascular and endocrine disorders, although its clinical efficacy and long-term effects are not fully elucidated yet. GLA, which accounts for approximately 24% of the oil, is converted to dihomo-Î³-linolenic acid (DGLA) which acts as a precursor to anti-inflammatory mediators such as 1-series prostaglandins and the 3-series leukotrienes. Borage oil may be found in foods or in skin care products.
