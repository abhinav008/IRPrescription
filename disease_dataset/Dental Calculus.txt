1. Name:  Invert sugar
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Invert sugar is obtained from sugar cane when this is treated with dilute acid or with the invertase enzyme. It is formed by an equal amount of glucose and fructose. It differentiates from sugar cane in the rotation of the polarized light, which in the case of invert sugar it is to the left (levorotatory).[1] Invert sugar is FDA approved since 1988 as a safe substance (GRAS).
4. Indication:  Invert sugar presents a large variety of uses. It can be used therapeutically for parenteral hyperalimentation[6] or to be used as an excipient with a known effect.[10] Invert sugar is also approved for its use in food products as a humectant, crystallization modifier, and liquid and nutritive sweetener.[7]

1. Name:  Calcium glycerophosphate
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Calcium glycerophosphate is a calcium salt of glycerophosphoric acid that forms a white, fine, slightly hygroscopic powder. The commercial product is a mixture of calcium beta-, and D-, and L -alpha-glycerophosphate. By FDA, calcium glycerophosphate is considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food ingredient as a nutrient supplement (source of calcium or phosphorus), or in food products such as gelatins, puddings, and fillings. It is also present in dental or oral hygiene products due to its cariostatic effects. It is suggested that calcium glycerophosphate promotes plaque-pH buffering, elevation of plaque calcium and phosphate levels and direct interaction with dental mineral [2].

1. Name:  Stannous fluoride
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Stannous Fluoride, or Tn(II) Fluoride, is a compound commonly used in toothpastes for the prevention of gingivitis, dental infections, cavities, and to relieve dental hypersensitivity. Although similar in function and activity to Sodium Fluoride (NaF), the conventionally added ingredient in toothpastes, stannous fluoride has been shown to be more effective at stopping and reversing dental lesions [2]. It manages and prevents dental caries and gingivitis by promoting enamel mineralization [1], reducing gingival inflammation and bleeding [3, 4] through its potential broad-spectrum antibiotic effect and modulation of the microbial composition of the dental biofilm [2]. It is an FDA-approved over-the-counter product.
4. Indication:  Indicated for use to relieve dental hypersensitivity, increase enamel production, prevent gingivitis and cavities, and control periodontal infections.
