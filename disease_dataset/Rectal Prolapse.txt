1. Name:  Shark liver oil
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Shark oil is extracted from the livers of sharks, which can account for up to 25% of their total body weight.

Sodium ion is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Sodium sulfate anhydrous is an electrolyte replenisher and is used in isosmotic solutions so that administration does not disturb normal electrolyte balance and does not lead to absorption or excretion of water and ions.
