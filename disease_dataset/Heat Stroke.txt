1. Name:  AX200
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  AX200, which has been developed for the treatment of stroke, is the most advanced drug candidate and is halfway through the process of gaining clinical approval. The expression of the endogenous AX200 protein in the brain is increased after brain damage. Thus, if this drug administered in the acute phase of stroke, the brain’s own protective action is supported. And this is where the double neurotherapeutic approach is most beneficial: AX200 stops neuronal cell death in the acute phase of stroke, while stimulating simultaneously the regeneration of nervous tissue through the induction of neuro- and arteriogenesis and supporting the reorganisation of the nervous system.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in cardiovascular disorders and strokes.

1. Name:  Bicisate
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Bicisate, also known as ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD), presents a molecular formula os N,N'-1,2-ethylene-di-yl-bis-L-cysteinate diethyl ester. It is usually complex with technetium Tc99m for its usage as a tracer to measure cerebral blood flow with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).[1] The complex of bicisate and technetium Tc99m as a kit was developed by Lantheus Medcl and FDA-approved on November 23, 1994.[8]
4. Indication:  Bicisate as a complex with technetium Tc-99m is used in single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) as an adjunct to conventional CT or MRI in the localization of stroke in patients whom the presence of a stroke has already been diagnosed. It is not indicated to assess the functional viability of brain tissue or to distinguish between a stroke and other brain lesions.[10]A stroke is defined as a condition in which the blood stops flowing to any part of the brain causing a damage to brain cells. The potential effect of a stroke depends on the part of the brain that was affected by it as well as the extension of the damage.[11]
