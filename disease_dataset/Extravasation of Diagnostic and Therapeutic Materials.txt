1. Name:  Poliglusam
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Poliglusam, also commonly known as chitosan, is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed β-(1→4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit) [Wikipedia]. Naturally-occuring poliglusam is found in the cell walls of fungi, soil and sediments where it is produced from degradation of chitin induced by certain groups of bacteria that produce the enzymes deacetylase or chitosanase enzymes [1]. In comparison, commercial poliglusam is derived from deacetylation of chitin contained in the shells of various sea crustaceans such as shrimps [1]. As a rich source of dietary fiber, chitosan is used as a food ingredient or additive. It is also reported to have an effect on protein aggregation, emulsification capacity, film-forming ability, clarifying ability, and fatty acid absorption capability [1]. In addition, chitosan also exhibits antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.

1. Name:  Pentastarch
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Pentastarch is an artificial colloid (hydroxyethyl starch derivative). Pentastarch is a subgroup of hydroxyethyl starch, with five hydroxyethyl groups out of each 11 hydroxyls, giving it approximately 50% hydroxyethylation. This compares with tetrastarch at 40% and hetastarch at 70% hydroxyethylation, respectively. It is sold under the name Pentaspan by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is used for fluid resuscitation. It is considered a plasma expander because it remains primarily intravascular after infusion. 
4. Indication:  The primary intended use of pentastarch is as a substitute for older colloids such as albumin or hetastarch for use in plasma volume expansion.

1. Name:  Poloxamer 188
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Poloxamer 188 is a nonionic linear copolymer with sufactant properties. Composed of two hydrophilic side-chains attached to a hydrophobic center core [2], its average molecular weight is 8400 Daltons.

1. Name:  Cholecystokinin
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Cholecystokinin ( also known as CCK or CCK-PZ) is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system which is responsible for stimulating the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin, previously called pancreozymin, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine) and leads to the release of bile and digestive enzymes. CCK also acts as an appetite suppressant and has been studied for weight management regimens [12]. Normally, it is an endogenous hormone but is available commercially for diagnostic processes and replacement in pancreatic insufficiency [21, 22, 23]. in the octapeptide form.Cholecystokinin is one of the first gastrointestinal hormones discovered, identified more than 90 years ago due to its ability to stimulate gallbladder contraction in 1928. Soon after, it was recognized to be identical to the factor responsible for stimulating pancreatic exocrine secretion in 1943 [11]. This hormone has also been shown to have positive effects on enteric smooth muscle contraction and on nerve activity at multiple locations in the peripheral and central nervous system. In addition to its roles in promoting smooth muscle cell contraction/exocrine cell secretion, CCK promotes cell growth, energy production, gene expression and protein synthesis, processes that have profound for drug development [11]. This drug has also been investigated for possible antipsychotic properties, owing to its effect on CCK receptors in the brain [13].Recent studies have suggested that cholecystokinin also plays a major role in inducing drug tolerance to opioids such as morphine and heroin, and is partially implicated in experiences of pain hypersensitivity during opioid withdrawal [1].
4. Indication:  For use as a diagnostic aid for evaluation of gallbladder disorders. It is also used in conjunction with secretin in pancreatic insufficiency [9].
