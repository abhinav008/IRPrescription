1. Name:  Glycine betaine
2. Groups:  Approved, Nutraceutical
3. Description:  Betaine is a methyl group donor that functions in the normal metabolic cycle of methionine and reduces homocystinuria in patients with inborn errors of methionine metabolism. In the United States, betaine is distributed under the brand name CystadaneÂ® by Rare Disease Therapeutics. Many reports have shown that betaine's therapeutic effectiveness is limited, and does not lower tHcy levels or prevent clinical symptoms [2].
4. Indication:  Betaine is indicated for the treatment of homocystinuria to decrease elevated homocysteine blood levels. Included within the category of homocystinuria are deficiencies or defects in: 1. cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 2. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), 3. cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).

1. Name:  Attapulgite
2. Groups:  Approved, Vet approved
3. Description:  Attapulgite is a magnesium aluminium phyllosilicate which occurs in a type of clay soil common to the Southeastern United States. When used in medicine, it physically binds to acids and toxic substances in the stomach and digestive tract. For that reason, it has often been used in antidiarrheal medications. Until 2003, it was the active ingredient used in Kaopectate, before that product was reformulated with bismuth subsalicylate.
4. Indication:  When used in medicine, it physically binds to acids and toxic substances in the stomach and digestive tract. For that reason, it has often been used in antidiarrheal medications. Attapulgite is an adsorbent.

1. Name:  Selenious acid
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Selenious acid is the acid form of sodium selenite, a form of selenium [8].Selenium is an essential trace element and antioxidant. It is a cofactor metabolic enzyme regulation. It also plays an important role in maintaining the general health of tissue and muscle and has antioxidant properties. Selenium is a component of glutathione peroxidase enzyme, which protects cell components from oxidative damage due to peroxides produced during cellular metabolism [13].Selenium (Se) has been demonstrated to prevent cancer in numerous animal models when administered selenium at levels exceeding the nutritional requirements. One study showed efficacy in the prevention of malignancy while utilizing a selenium supplement in humans. The reports from such studies have heightened the interest in additional human selenium supplementation studies to validate the results in larger populations [15].Interestingly, selenium is being studied as a potential therapy in the prevention or management of atherosclerosis [18].
4. Indication:  Selenium injection is indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Administration of selenious acid in TPN formulas helps to maintain plasma selenium levels and also to maintain endogenous stores to prevent deficiency [19].Selenium compounds, such as selenium sulfide, are used topically in anti-dandruff shampoos and in cases of seborrhea [13]. For the purpose of brevity, selenite will the focus of discussion, and more information about selenium can be obtained at Selenium.

1. Name:  Carbon monoxide
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions.
