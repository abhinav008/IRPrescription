1. Name:  Demecarium
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent that is used to treat glaucoma. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor or an anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. Demecarium inactivates both pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle. The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure.
4. Indication:  For the topical treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.
DrugId:  10

1. Name:  Aloe Polysaccharide
2. Groups:  Approved, Experimental
3. Description:  Aloe describes a genus including over 500 species of flowering succulent plants that grow in the Southern peninsula and various islands. Aloe vera is the most common species of Aloe that is cultivated for agricultural and medical purposes. It is a perennial succulent xerophyte with elongated leaves that contain a clear gel. The aloe vera gel is a rich source of polysaccharides, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, anthraquinones, enzymes, lignin, saponins, and salicylic acids. Some of the polysaccharides that are active constituents of aloe vera gel include acemannan, mannose, and cellulosic glucose. While aloe vera has a long history of commercial uses, it is still widely used in cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical products.
