1. Name:  SGN-30
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  SGN-30 is an engineered monoclonal antibody (mAb) that reacts with significant affinity to the CD30 antigen, which is highly expressed on a variety of hematologic malignancies as compared to on normal cells. SGN-30 has been shown to induce direct anti-cancer activity towards tumor cells expressing CD30 and is undergoing phase II trials for cancer therapy. SGN-30 has demonstrated objective antitumor responses as a single agent in phase II clinical trials. We are collaborating with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) on three clinical trials of SGN-30 in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, front-line ALCL and pediatric ALCL.SGN-30 received orphan drug designation from the FDA in July 2003 for Hodgkin lymphoma and in February 2004 for T-cell lymphomas.

1. Name:  Axicabtagene ciloleucel
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Axicabtagene ciloleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the treatment of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is a type of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is the second cell-based gene therapy that is FDA-approved but the first in the treatment of large B-cell lymphoma in adult patients. Uniquely, axicabtagene ciloleucel utilizes each patient’s own immune system where each dose of the drug consists of the patient's genetically modified T-cells that were previously collected. The modified version of the T-cell expresses a new gene that targets and kills the lymphoma cells and is infused back into the patient. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL in adults that mostly originates from the lymph nodes but can initiate outside of the lymphatic system. Lymphoma cells appear to be much larger in size than normal lymphocytes. In a multicenter clinical trial, the patients who were treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved the complete remission rate of 51%. Developed by Kite Pharma, Inc., it was approved on October 18th, 2017 by the FDA as an intravenously infused anticancer therapy and is marketed under the brand name Yescarta.
4. Indication:  Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.
