1. Name:  MB07811
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  MB07811 is the first of a novel class of product candidates discovered by Metabasis designed to lower serum cholesterol and triglycerides. MB07811, a small molecule that is administered orally, has been extensively studied preclinically and is currently undergoing clinical testing. MB07811 combines a novel thyroid hormone receptor agonist with the Company's novel HepDirect liver targeting prodrug technology. The combination of selectivity for the beta form of the receptor, liver targeting and other structural characteristics that limit extra-hepatic activity is designed to provide significant efficacy while avoiding side effects associated with activation of thyroid hormone receptors outside the liver.

1. Name:  Technetium Tc-99m mebrofenin
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Technetium Tc 99m Mebrofenin is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical composed of diisopropyl-iminodiacetic acid (DISIDA) attached to a technetium-99m ion. Following intravenous injection, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging of the liver or gallbladder is performed using a gamma camera to detect the gamma rays emitted by the technetium-99m as it decays. This is possible as Technetium-99m decays by isomeric transition to technetium-99 through the release of a gamma ray. Liver and gallbladder imaging is enabled through attachment to mebrofenin as this molecule has high hepatic uptake and fast biliary excretion, resulting in improved hepatic imaging. More specifically, mebrofenin is taken up into hepatocytes through the action of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters.Currently available within a sterile kit, Tc-99m Mebrofenin is indicated for imaging of the liver and gallbladder.
4. Indication:  Technetium Tc 99m Mebrofenin is indicated as a hepatobiliary imaging agent.

1. Name:  Technetium Tc-99m disofenin
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Technetium Tc-99m disofenin is a radiopharmaceutical agent used in hepatobiliary imaging for diagnostic purposes. It is well suited for both planar and single photon tomographic scintigraphy to quantitatively measure the function of liver, gallbladder and bile ducts and detect any anatomical changes in the hepatobliary system. It is available as an intravenous injection in a preparation kit under the name Hepatolite. Technetium Tc-99m is a metastable nuclear isomer and disofenin is an iminodiacetic acid derivative with no known pharmacologic actions at the doses recommended. However disofenin is the most commonly used iminodiacetic acid since it has a high liver to renal extraction and its hepatic uptake is not as highly dependent on serum bilirubin levels (a competitive inhibitor for liver uptake) as are other tracers from the iminodiacetic acid.
4. Indication:  Technetium Tc99m Disofenin is indicated as a hepatobiliary imaging agent. Hepatolite is indicated in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis as well as to rule out the occurrence of acute cholecystitis in suspected patients with right upper quadrant pain, fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness and mass or rebound tenderness, but not limited to these signs and symptoms.
