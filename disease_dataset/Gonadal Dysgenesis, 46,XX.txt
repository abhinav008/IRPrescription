1. Name:  Androstenedione
2. Groups:  Experimental, Illicit
3. Description:  A delta-4 C19 steroid that is produced not only in the testis, but also in the ovary and the adrenal cortex. Depending on the tissue type, androstenedione can serve as a precursor to testosterone as well as estrone and estradiol.
4. Indication:  Not Available
DrugId:  13
1. Name:  Mesterolone
2. Groups:  Experimental
3. Description:  Mesterolone is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is inactivated by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in skeleta muscules so it is considered a weak androgen. It is not a substrate for aromatase so it is not converted into estrogen. Mesterolone demonstrated to have minimal effect on sperm counts and levels of FSH or LH [1, 2]. Experiments of mesterolone serving as a potential treatment of depression are still undergoing.
4. Indication:  Not Available
DrugId:  14
1. Name:  16-Bromoepiandrosterone
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  16-Bromoepiandrosterone is an injectable formulation of a compound called alpha-epi-bromide. It is a chemical relative of DHEA which was selected for development after it showed antiretroviral activity in laboratory tests.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, hepatitis (viral, B), and malaria.
DrugId:  15
1. Name:  5-androstenedione
2. Groups:  Experimental, Illicit
3. Description:  5-androstenedione is a prohormone of testosterone. In the United States, the Controlled Substance Act is inclusive to anabolic steroids and their precursors. Thus 5-androstenedione is a controlled substance. The World Anti-Doping Agency also prohibits use of 5-androstenedione in athletes. 5-androstenedione is structurally similar to 4-androstenedione, with the exception of the positioning of a carbon-carbon double bond. 4-Androstenedione is a prohormone which is naturally produced in the body by the adrenal glands and gonads, and acts as precursor to testosterone, as well as estrone and estradiol.

1. Name:  Androstenediol
2. Groups:  Experimental, Illicit
3. Description:  An intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis, found in the testis or the adrenal glands. Androstenediol, derived from dehydroepiandrosterone by the reduction of the 17-keto group (17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases), is converted to testosterone by the oxidation of the 3-beta hydroxyl group to a 3-keto group (3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases).
