1. Name:  Recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  Alpha 1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein primarily produced by hepatocytes, and to a lesser extent, immune system cells. Recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) is produced from yeast, which unlike commercially available forms of plasma-derived AAT, eliminates the risk associated with blood-borne infectious agents and allows for a increased manufacturing. rAAT belongs to a family of structurally-related proteins classified as serine protease inhibitors or SERPINS, which are known to inhibit several proteases including trypsin, cathepsin G, thrombin, tissue kallikrein, as well as neutrophil elastase. The proteinase/antiproteinase balance is believed to be important for maintaining healthy skin. The rAAT topical gel (Dermolastinâ„¢) is indicated for patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The company has indicated that other formulations for gastroenterological and urological indications will also be developed.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, atopic dermatitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

1. Name:  Thrombin Alfa
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Thrombin Alfa is a human coagulation protein produced via recombinant DNA technology from a genetically modified CHO cell line. Thrombin Alfa is identical in amino acid sequence and structurally similar to naturally occurring human thrombin. Thrombin Alfa precursor is secreted to culture medium as single chain form that is proteolytically converted to a two-chain active form (using a protein derived from snakes) and is purified by a chromatographic process that yields a product having hemostatic activities similar to native human thrombin. The cell line used to manufacture Thrombin Alfa has been tested and shown to be free of known infectious agents. The cell culture process used in the manufacture of Thrombin Alfa employs no additives of human or animal origin. The purification process includes solvent-detergent treatment and nano-filtration steps dedicated to viral clearance.Nevertheless, because the incidence of hemostasis within a timely manner is relatively comparable between the use of thrombin alfa and the placebo treatment in patient subjects, thrombin alfa is not currently approved by certain organizations like the European Medicines Agency [2].
4. Indication:  Indicated to aid hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, or cautery) is ineffective or impractical in adults and pediatric populations greater than or equal to one month of age [FDA Label].Additionally, thrombin alfa can be used in conjunction with an absorbable gelatin sponge, USP [FDA Label].
