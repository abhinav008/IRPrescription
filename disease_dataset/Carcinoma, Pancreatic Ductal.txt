1. Name:  PX-12
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide) is a small-molecule inhibitor of Trx-1 (thioredoxin-1), stimulates apoptosis, down-regulates HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits tumor growth in animal models. Since high levels of Trx-1 have been associated with colorectal, gastric and lung cancers, PX-12 is indicated as a potential cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy for patients with advanced metastatic cancer. Initial trials correlated doses of Px-12 with increased patient survival.

1. Name:  TM30339
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  TM30339 is an analogue of the natural hormone Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), which is released in connection with meals. TM30339 works through the same receptor as the natural satiety hormone, Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), but TM30339 has improved properties compared with PP. TM30339 thus imitates a natural mechanism, a satiety signal from the gastrointestinal system involved in the regulation of food intake in humans. TM30339 is developed for the treatment of obesity.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders.
