1. Name:  SNS-314
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  SNS-314 is a potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora kinases A, B, and C. Proliferating cells treated with SNS-314 bypass the mitotic spindle checkpoint and fail to undergo cytokinesis, leading to multiple rounds of endoreduplication and eventually cell death. SNS-314 inhibits tumor growth in a variety of preclinical models, and it is now being tested in single agent Phase 1 studies in patients with advanced solid tumours.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in solid tumors.

1. Name:  GSK-923295
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  GSK-923295 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E), and the third novel drug candidate to arise from Cytokinetics' broad strategic alliance with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK-923295 demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against a range of human tumor xenografts grown in nude mice, including models of colon, breast, ovarian, lung and other tumors. GSK-923295 is the first drug candidate to enter human clinical trials that specifically targets CENP-E and is currently in Phase I human clinical trials being conducted by GSK.

1. Name:  Vinorelbine
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [5]. It was initially approved in the USA in 1990's for the treatment of NSCLC [13].It is a third-generation vinca alkaloid. The introduction of third-generation drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with very similar results from the various drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in the combination treatment setting [2].A study was done on the clearance rate of vinorelbine on individuals with various single polymorphonuclear mutations. It was found that there was 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance across the cohort, suggesting a strong influence of genetics on the clearance of this drug [7].
4. Indication:  Vinorelbine tartrate is indicated for adults in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a single therapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs [5].Used in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, in combination with other chemotherapy agents [14].For the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis, in combination with methotrexate [14].For the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer [14].For the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer [14].For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, in patients previously treated with anthracyline and/or taxane therapy [14].For the treatment of HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, advanced breast cancer in patients previously treated with a taxane, in combination with trastuzumab and everolimus [14].

1. Name:  Vincristine
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Vincristine is an antitumor vinca alkaloid isolated from Vinca Rosea.

Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia, and acute panmyelosis. vincristine sulfate is often chosen as part of polychemotherapy because of lack of significant bone–marrow suppression (at recommended doses) and of unique clinical toxicity (neuropathy). 
4. Indication:  Treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma. Liposomal vincristine is indicated for the treatment of relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

1. Name:  Human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cell
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells consist of hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes from human cord blood. They are used during allogeneic unrelated and related hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures in patients with disorders affecting the hematopoietic system that are inherited, acquired, or result from myeloablative treatment. Human umbilical cord is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells that are capable of proliferation in vitro. Active and viable hematopoietic progenitor cells, or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express the cell surface marker CD34 which is critical for cell identification [1]. Upon division and maturation at the bone marrow following intravenous administration to the patient, hematopoietic progenitor cells enter the systemic circulation to restore blood counts and function [FDA Label].After the first cord blood transplant in 1988 in a patient with Fanconi anemia [3], the use of umbilical cord blood transplantation was increased in clinical settings. Human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells can be collected from both related or unrelated donors. The unrelated donor transplant setting has several advantages over related donor transplant and bone marrow transplantation; it allows shorter time to transplant and tolerance of 1–2 human leukocyte antigen mismatch due to expanded donor pool, which increases the chance of finding a suitable donor, particularly in patients requiring urgent transplantation [2]. Other advantages of HSC transplantation include a lower risk of transmitting infections by latent viruses and improved targeting of ethnic minorities increased pool of rare haplotypes [2]. Umbilical cord blood cell transplantation was also associated with reduced incidence and severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD) thus improved survival rates of transplant patients compared to allogeneic bone marrow transplant setting, which may be due to "naive" nature of lymphocytes [4]. Hemacord is marketed in the U.S. as an allogeneic cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cell therapy for intravenous use.
4. Indication:  Indicated for use in unrelated donor hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation procedures in conjunction with an appropriate preparative regimen for hematopoietic and immunologic reconstitution in patients with disorders affecting the hematopoietic system that are inherited, acquired, or result from myeloablative treatment [FDA Label].
