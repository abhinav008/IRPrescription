1. Name:  ACA 125
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  An IgG1 murine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody (Ab2), ACA-125, was developed to bind to anti-CA 125 antibodies. ACA-125 mimics the tumor-associated antigen CA-125, which can be detected in about 80% of ovarian carcinomas.This new concept of oncological immunotherapy consists of an attempt to trigger the immune system of the host to respond against tumor cells. Antiidiotypic antibodies bearing the internal image of an antigen expressed on the surface of the tumor are suited to this approach. To create ACA-125, a hybridoma cell was adapted to serum-free medium and antibody was produced in a hollow fiber cell culture system. Positive clinical results are now being reported.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in ovarian cancer.

1. Name:  Acalabrutinib
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  To date, acalabrutinib has been used in trials studying the treatment of B-All, Myelofibrosis, Ovarian Cancer, Multiple Myeloma, and Hodgkin Lymphoma, among others.As of October 31, 2017 the FDA approved Astra Zeneca's orally administered Calquence (acalabrutinib) medication as a Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy, marking the company's first entry into the treatment of blood cancers.Also known as ACP-196, acalabrutinib is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK.Nevertheless, acalabrutinib was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for acalabrutinib's currently accepted indication may subsequently be contingent upon ongoing verification and description of clinical benefit in confimatory trials.Furthermore, the FDA granted this medication Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. It also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. At this time, more than 35 clinical trials across 40 countries with more than 2500 patients are underway or have been completed with regards to further research into better understanding and expanding the therapeutic uses of acalabrutinib [4].
4. Indication:  Acalabrutinib is currently indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy [FDA Label].
