1. Name:  Gemcitabine
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog used as chemotherapy. It is marketed as Gemzar® by Eli Lilly and Company. As with fluorouracil and other analogues of pyrimidines, the drug replaces one of the building blocks of nucleic acids, in this case cytidine, during DNA replication. The process arrests tumor growth, as new nucleosides cannot be attached to the "faulty" nucleoside, resulting in apoptosis (cellular "suicide").Gemcitabine is used in various carcinomas: non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer and breast cancer. It is being investigated for use in oesophageal cancer, and is used experimentally in lymphomas and various other tumor types.
4. Indication:  Gemcitabine is indicated for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer that has relapsed at least 6 months after completion of platinum-based therapy; metastatic ovarian cancer; inoperable, locally advanced (Stage IIIA or IIIB), or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer; and locally advanced (nonresectable Stage II or Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
DrugId:  23

4. Indication:  For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. Also used as a single agent in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy. It is also used in combination with prednisone, in the treatment of patients with androgen independent (hormone refractory) metastatic prostate cancer.

1. Name:  Tenofovir alafenamide
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and a novel ester prodrug of the antiretroviral tenofovir. Following oral administration, TAF is converted in vivo to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5′-monophosphate. Tenofovir mimics normal DNA building blocks but is lacking a 3'-OH molecule required for phosphodiester bond linkage. By competing with regular nucleotides for incorporation into proviral DNA and prevention of the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage required for DNA elongation, tenofovir causes early chain termination and prevents proviral DNA transcription. Although tenofovir (available as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) has a good safety profile and efficacy, and is currently a cornerstone of HIV antiviral treatment, its use has been associated with nephrotoxicity and reduced bone mineral density. In comparison, TAF has been shown to have improved antiviral efficacy, enhanced delivery of TFV into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphatic tissues, a higher barrier to resistance, and an improved safety profile. Improved renal safety is likely attributable to lower circulating plasma concentrations of tenofovir and therefore less exposure and damage to bone and the kidneys, where tenofovir is metabolized. Because HIV antiretroviral therapy is usually life-long, reduced toxicity and improved efficacy results in better patient outcomes and improved adherence in the long term.Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate is currently available in two fixed dose combination products: Odefsey (emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir alafenamide), and Descovy (emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide). Both products are indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.
4. Indication:  For use in the treatment of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B.

1. Name:  LX1031
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  LX1031 is an orally-dosed drug candidate for irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders. LX1031 was generated by Lexicon medicinal chemists, and its target was internally identified as a key control point for the regulation of peripheral serotonin levels. LX1031 is designed to act locally in the gastrointestinal tract by reducing the serotonin available for receptor activation, without affecting serotonin levels in the brain or its central nervous system functions.
4. Indication:  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other gastrointestinal disorders
