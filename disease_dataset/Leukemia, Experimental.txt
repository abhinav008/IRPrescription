1. Name:  AGRO100

1. Name:  XL999
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  XL999 has the potential to provide benefit to patients with lung cancer and acute myelogenous leukemia. XL999 is a new chemical entity that inhibits a spectrum of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) with growth promoting and angiogenic properties, including FGFR 1/3, PDGFRα/β, VEGFR2/KDR, KIT, and FLT3. XL999 also inhibits FLT4 and SRC. XL999 has the potential to prevent tumor growth — both directly by a novel effect on tumor cell proliferation and indirectly through inhibition of the host angiogenic response. XL999 induces a cell-cycle block by a mechanism distinct from those previously identified and exhibits broad antitumor activity in xenograft models.
