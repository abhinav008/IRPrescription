1. Name:  CRx-401
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  CRx-401 is a novel insulin sensitizer designed to provide anti-diabetic activity without promoting weight gain. It consists of a low dose of the analgesic diflunisal in conjunction with a modified-release therapeutic dose of bezafibrate, an anti-cholesterol agent. In third-party clinical studies, the dose of bezafibrate contained in CRx-401 has been observed to have a positive impact on cellular pathways that influence glycemic and lipid profiles, and this dose has proven to be well tolerated in clinical trials. Unlike other NSAIDs, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the dose of diflunisal in CRx-401 has demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to synergistically enhance the anti-diabetic effects of bezafibrate through novel disease-targeted mechanisms.
