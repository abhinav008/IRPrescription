1. Name:  Parathyroid hormone
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a single-chain polypeptide composed of 84 amino acids. As Preotact, it contains recombinant human parathyroid hormone which is identical to the full-length native 84-amino acid polypeptide. It is produced as a fusion protein. Post-translational processing involves the cleavage of the OmpA leader sequence, leaving the mature protein as a single-chain 84 amino-acids polypeptide (9.4 kDa) whose sequence is identical to that of the full-length native endogenous human PTH. It has no disulfide bonds and no glycosylation sites.Preotact is used in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of osteoporotic fractures. Preotact is marketed in Europe by Nycomed. Preos is a registered trade mark owned by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The name Preos and the New Drug Application is pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

1. Name:  Human calcitonin
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Calcitonin was first discovered in isolated parathyroid tissue as a substance with a serum-calcium-lowering effect.[2] It is constituted as a 32-amino acid single chain polypeptide structure that gets secreted as a regulatory agent in calcium-phosphorus metabolism.[1] It is used as an alternative for people developing antibodies against salmon calcitonin.[3]
4. Indication:  Human calcitonin is indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease in the cases where the use of salmon calcitonin may provoke the generation of high-titer of antibodies.[3] Paget's disease is a metabolic bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased and disorganized bone turnover coupled with an increased bone formation. The majority of the cases are asymptomatic but some clinical manifestations include pain, bone deformity and some complications such as pathological fractures and deafness.[4] The increased activity in bone is associated with a rise in serum level of alkaline phosphatase and the increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline which is a product of bone breakdown.[2]

1. Name:  Abaloparatide
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Abaloparatide is an analog of PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein). It was approved in April 28, 2017 by the FDA (as Tymlos) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Abaloparatide is a synthetic peptide that is related to hPTHrP and has demonstrated in preclinical testing the potential to widen the anabolic window for bone therapeutics, stimulating bone formation with a limited effect on bone resorption and mineral mobilization. This could enable improved convenience over currently available anabolic therapies, resulting in greater compliance and, ultimately, greater benefit to patients.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis to reduce vertebral and/or non-vertebral fractures.
