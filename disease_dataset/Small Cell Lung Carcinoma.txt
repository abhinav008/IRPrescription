1. Name:  PX-12
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide) is a small-molecule inhibitor of Trx-1 (thioredoxin-1), stimulates apoptosis, down-regulates HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits tumor growth in animal models. Since high levels of Trx-1 have been associated with colorectal, gastric and lung cancers, PX-12 is indicated as a potential cancer treatment in combination with chemotherapy for patients with advanced metastatic cancer. Initial trials correlated doses of Px-12 with increased patient survival.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in cancer/tumors (unspecified), gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
