1. Name:  Cat dander extract
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Cat dander extract is either subcutaneously or intracutaneously administered and contains dry cat dander or dry defatted cat pelt. It is used in the diagnosis and treatment (immunotherapy) of patients with a history of allergy to cats. An allergic reaction to cats is induced by the presence of antigen-specific IgE antibodies that are bound to specific receptors on mast cells and basophils. The allergy diagnostic process involves assessing allergy history, clinical evaluation, and skin test reactivity. Cat dander extract can be used in immunotherapy in individuals who cannot avoid exposure to cat allergens to initiate hyposensitization.
