1. Name:  Inotuzumab ozogamicin
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate using linker and cytotoxic drug technology similar to that developed for the ground-breaking treatment Mylotarg (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin), which was approved by the US FDA in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Inotuzumab ozogamicin consists of a recombinant humanised IgG4 kappa CD22-targeting monoclonal antibody covalently attached to calicheamicin derivative, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide, which is a potent DNA-binding cytotoxic agent [4]. Developed by Pfizer and UCB, inotuzumab ozogamicin was granted approval by EU in June 2017 followed by FDA on August 17th, 2017 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL is a rapidly progressing cancer of the bone marrow that is associated with high mortality rates and low therapeutic response from standard chemotherapies in relasping conditions. In a randomized trial, inotuzumab ozogamicin displayed higher percentages of patients undergoing longer periods of complete remission with no evidence of disease in comparison to patients receiving alternative chemotherapy [5].
4. Indication:  Indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
