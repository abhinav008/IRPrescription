1. Name:  LY2140023
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  LY2140023 is an investigational drug from Lilly, which is being developed as a new treatment option for schizophrenia. LY2140023 is an oral "prodrug," meaning it is devoid of intrinsic biological activity and, once administered, is metabolized to provide the active mGlu2/3 receptor agonist called LY404039. Most currently approved antipsychotic medications work by affecting the neurotransmitters dopamine or serotonin. For LY2140023, the active substance, LY404039, is thought to work by reducing the presynaptic release of another neurotransmitter, glutamate, in brain regions where mGlu2/3 receptors are expressed. Further studies are planned or are ongoing to learn more about the safety and effectiveness, including determining an optimal therapeutic dose for LY2140023.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in psychosis and schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders.

1. Name:  Paliperidone
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of the older antipsychotic risperidone. While its specific mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed that paliperidone and risperidone act via similar if not the same pathways. It has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for treatment of schizophrenia on December 20, 2006.
4. Indication:  For the treatment of schizophrenia.

1. Name:  TM30339
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  TM30339 is an analogue of the natural hormone Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), which is released in connection with meals. TM30339 works through the same receptor as the natural satiety hormone, Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), but TM30339 has improved properties compared with PP. TM30339 thus imitates a natural mechanism, a satiety signal from the gastrointestinal system involved in the regulation of food intake in humans. TM30339 is developed for the treatment of obesity.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders.
