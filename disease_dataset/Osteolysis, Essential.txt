1. Name:  Incadronic acid
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Incadronic acid is a third generation bisphosphonate which can suppress bone resorption by osteoclasts. It is used to treat hypercalcemia, and bone disorders associated with malignancy and osteoporosis. In rats with induced hypercalcemia, incadronate has been found to be 46 times more potent than pamidronate and 11 times more potent than aledronate.Incadronate has also been found to have anti-tumor effects in mice. In rat models of breast cancer, bisphosphonate treatment has been shown to inhibit the progression and development of bone metastases and reduce tumor burden in vivo. It has also been recognized as a potential treatment for adult T-cell leukaemia which is characterized by hypercalcemia and tumor-induced osteolysis. [2] Incadronate, as well as other nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as aledronate and minodronate, have been found to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells. In vitro human myeloma cells have undergone apoptosis when exposed to incadronate. [5] When combined with Tipifarnib, a potent farnesyl transferase inhibitor which can suppress the growth of myeloma cells, growth suppression of myeloma cells in vitro is intensified. [6] Because of these findings Incadronate is being investigated as a treatment for multiple myeloma, a B-cell malignancy associated with bone loss. Incadronate is available by prescription only, and is not marked is the United States, UK, Canada, or Australia. It is an approved treatment for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia (MAH) in Japan.[8]

1. Name:  Chymotrypsin
2. Groups:  Approved, Vet approved
3. Description:  Chymotrypsin is a digestive enzyme synthesized in the pancreas that plays an essential role in proteolysis, or the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides. As a component in the pancreatic juice, chymotrypsin aids in the digestion of proteins in the duodenum by preferentially cleaving peptide amide bonds where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P1 position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine) [Wikipedia]. Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates. Through the cleavage of enzymatically inactive precursor chymotrypsinogen by trypsin, chymotrypsin is activated. It also induces its own activation by cleaving essential amino acid residues in the oxyanion hole to produce α-Chymotrypsin, which is a more stable form than π-Chymotrypsin.

1. Name:  RG2417
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  RG2417 is a proprietary formulation of uridine, a biological compound essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, the basic hereditary material found in all cells, and numerous other factors essential for cell metabolism. Uridine is synthesized by the mitochondria, the power plant of the human cell responsible for energy metabolism. The rationale for uridine therapy in neuropsychiatric disorders is supported by preclinical and clinical research. Recent reports indicate that certain genes that encode for mitochondrial proteins are significantly down regulated in the brains of bipolar patients. This new insight suggests that the symptoms of bipolar disorder may be linked to dysregulation of energy metabolism of the brain. 
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in bipolar disorders and manic disorders.

1. Name:  Docosahexaenoate
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Docosahexaenoate (DHA) is a long-chain, highly unsaturated omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid with 22-carbon chain and six cis double bonds. It can be synthesised from the plant essential fatty acid α-linolenic acid (ALA) or obtained from other sources such as breast milk, fish oil and algae oil. As a major structural component in human brain tissues, retina and skin, DHA plays an essential role in growth and functional development of the brain in infants as well as maintenance of normal brain function in adults [1]. DHA is available as oral dietary supplements and added in food products.
