1. Name:  Nitrofurantoin
2. Groups:  Approved, Vet approved
3. Description:  A bacteriostatic or bactericidal agent depending on the concentration and susceptibility of the infecting organism. Nitrofurantoin is active against some gram positive organisms such as S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, S. agalactiae, group D streptococci, viridians streptococci and Corynebacterium. Its spectrum of activity against gram negative organisms includes E. coli, Enterobacter, Neisseria, Salmonella and Shigella. It may be used as an alternative to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for treating urinary tract infections though it may be less effective at eradicating vaginal bacteria. May also be used in females as prophylaxis against recurrent cystitis related to coitus. Nitrofurantoin is highly stable to the development of bacterial resistance, a property thought to be due to its multiplicity of mechanisms of action. 
4. Indication:  May be used as an alternative in the treatment of urinary tract infections. May be used by females pericoitally for prophylaxis against recurrent cystitis related to coitus.

1. Name:  PBI-1402
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  PBI-1402 is a small molecule synthetic compound with oralBioavailability. The compound activates neutrophils, enhancing their survival and activation with comparable efficacy to GM-CSF, G-CSF and EPO, which are currently used to treat anemia. However, it has been shown that when co-administered with these compounds, effects are additive, making PBI-1402 an excellent candidate for combination therapy and asserting its independent mechanism of action. PBI-1402 appears to work on the PMN pathway, but its specific binding properties are not known. PBI-1402 has a dual therapeutic action; as a chemoprotectant and hematopoietic progenitor stimulator. Since it stimulates immune activity, it has been considered as a candidate for cancer treatment as well as anemia.
4. Indication:  Investigated for use/treatment in adverse effects (chemotherapy), anemia, and chemotherapy.
