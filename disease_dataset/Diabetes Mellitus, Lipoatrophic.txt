1. Name:  NOX-700
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  NOX-700, an new orally active dithiocarbamate-based nitric oxide (NO) blocking agent that is in development for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes). In animal studies, NOX-700 lowered serum glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced the percentage of total glycated hemoglobin. Immunohistochemical studies onpancreatic tissue also showed that NOX-700 therapy effectively preserved islet structure and increased insulin immunoreactivity. It has since been found that oxidative signaling of the redox-sensitive transcription factor, NF-ÎºB, and inhibiting protein glycation are responsible for the drug's therapeutic effects.
