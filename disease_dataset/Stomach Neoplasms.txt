1. Name:  Pepsin
2. Groups:  Approved, Experimental, Investigational
3. Description:  Pepsin is a peptide hydrolase produced in the stomach that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. When hydrochloric acid mixes with the zymogen pepsinogen that is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall, the acidic environment promotes the autocatalytic cleavage of pepsinogen to form the activated form of pepsin. Pepsin is an aspartic protease that uses a catalytic aspartate in its active site and is most effective in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids. Pepsin used as a food ingredient in commercial application is extracted from hog stomach. It is used in pharmaceutical applications to prepare and purify antibody fragments.
