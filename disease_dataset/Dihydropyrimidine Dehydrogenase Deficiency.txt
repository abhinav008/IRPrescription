1. Name:  Eniluracil
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  Eniluracil, which was previously under development by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is being developed by Adherex to enhance the therapeutic value and effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), one of the worldâ€™s most widely-used oncology agents. 5-FU is widely used in the U.S. and is often first or second line therapy for a variety of cancers including colorectal, breast, gastric, head and neck, ovarian and basal cell cancer of the skin. Eniluracil could improve 5-FU by increasing its effectiveness, reducing its side effects and/or making it orally available. Eniluracil has received Orphan Drug status from the FDA for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer in combination with fluoropyrimidines (including 5-FU).
4. Indication:  For the treatment of cancer in combination with 5-fluorouracil.

1. Name:  Gimeracil
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Gimeracil is an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy, used to increase the concentration and effect of the main active componets within chemotherapy regimens. Approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2011, Gimeracil is available in combination with Oteracil and Tegafur within the commercially available product "Teysuno". The main active ingredient in Teysuno is Tegafur, a pro-drug of Fluorouracil (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called "pyrimidines" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth. Gimeracil's main role within Teysuno is to prevent the breakdown of Fluorouracil (5-FU), which helps to maintin high enough concentrations for sustained effect against cancer cells [2]. It functions by reversibly and selectively blocking the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which is involved in the degradation of 5-FU [1]. This allows higher concentrations of 5-FU to be achieved with a lower dose of tegafur, thereby also reducing toxic side effects.
4. Indication:  Gimeracil is used as an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy. When used within the product Teysuno, gimeracil is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced gastric (stomach) cancer when given in combination with cisplatin.

1. Name:  Tegafur
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Tegafur (INN, BAN, USAN) is a prodrug of Fluorouracil (5-FU), an antineoplastic agent used as the treatment of various cancers such as advanced gastric and colorectal cancers. It is a pyrimidine analogue used in combination therapies as an active chemotherapeutic agent in conjunction with Gimeracil and Oteracil, or along with Fluorouracil as Tegafur-uracil. Tegafur is usually given in combination with other drugs that enhance the bioavailability of the 5-FU or limit its toxicity. When metabolized and bioactivated to 5-FU, the drug mediates an antitumor activity by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS) to disrupt DNA replication in tumors. 5-FU is listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
4. Indication:  Indicated for the treatment of cancer usually in combination with other biochemically modulating drugs.

1. Name:  Estrone
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Estrone, one of the major mammalian estrogens, is an aromatized C18 steroid with a 3-hydroxyl group and a 17-ketone. It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol.
