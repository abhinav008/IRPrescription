1. Name:  Doconexent
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  A mixture of fish oil and primrose oil, doconexent is used as a high-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplement. DHA is a 22 carbon chain with 6 cis double bonds with anti-inflammatory effects. It can be biosythesized from alpha-linolenic acid or commercially manufactured from microalgae. It is an omega-3 fatty acid and primary structural component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin, and retina thus plays an important role in their development and function. The amino-phospholipid DHA is found at a high concentration across several brain subcellular fractions, including nerve terminals, microsomes, synaptic vesicles, and synaptosomal plasma membranes [10].

1. Name:  TST10088
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  TST10088 is a recombinant variant of a plant toxin belonging to the family of class II ribosome inactivating proteins. These molecules efficiently kill cells by activating preprogrammed death pathways known as apoptosis.

Cleavage of the peptide switch activates the prodrug causing ribosomal inactivation and the death of cancerous cells.

1. Name:  Necitumumab
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Necitumumab is an intravenously administered recombinant monoclonal IgG1 antibody used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as an EGFR antagonist. It functions by binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prevents binding of its ligands, a process that is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and malignant progression. Binding of necitumumab to EGFR induces receptor internalization and degradation, thereby preventing further activation of EGFR which is beneficial in NSCLC as many patients have increased protein expression of EGFR. Necitumumab is approved for use in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
4. Indication:  Necitumumab is approved for use in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is not indicated for treatment of non-squamous NSCLC.

1. Name:  Sage oil
2. Groups:  Approved, Nutraceutical
3. Description:  Sage oil is extracted from sage or Salvia officinalis, the herb commonly used for culinary purposes. Salvia officinalis is a common sage and a member of the genus Salvia, that includes aromatic and perennial plants with flowers. Essential oil has been traditionally used in medicine for the relief of pain and the treatment of inflammation and infections, as it is reported to exhibit carminative, antispasmodic, antiseptic, and astringent properties [2]. The main constituents of sage oil include camphor, 1,8-cineole, α-thujone, β-thujone, borneol, and viridiflorol, which are thought to mainly produce the biological effects of sage oil. Sage oil also contains flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds that mediate strong antioxidant, radical-scavenging, and antibacterial activities [2]. It is found in cosmetics, personal care products and dietary supplements.
