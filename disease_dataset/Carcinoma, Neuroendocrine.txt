1. Name:  Dotatate gallium Ga-68
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Dotatate gallium (Ga-68) is a somatostatin-2 receptor analog which is radiolabeled with gallium 68 as a positron-emitting radioisotope. Ga-68 dotatate has a high affinity for somatostatin-2 receptor and it is rapidly excreted from the nontarget sites which gives it an ideal candidate for imaging neuroendocrine tumors. Dotatate gallium (Ga-68) explotes its ability to detect somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and this characteristic tends to change with tumor grade which gives Ga-68 dotate a high diagnostic value.[1] Dotatate gallium 68 was developed by Advanced Accelerator Applications USA, Inc. and FDA approved in June 1, 2016.
4. Indication:  Dotatate gallium 68 is one of the most prominent radiopharmaceuticals used in imaging with positron emission tomography. It binds to the somatostatin-2 receptor which is usually overexpressed in many neuroendocrine tumors in both adult and pediatric patients.[2] The neuroendocrine tumors are bening or malignant tumors produced in the hormone producing cells of the neuroendocrine system.[7]

1. Name:  Everolimus
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Everolimus is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus), and works similarly to Rapamycin as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor.

In a similar fashion to other mTOR inhibitors Everolimus' effect is solely on the mTORC1 protein and not on the mTORC2 protein.
4. Indication:  Everolimus is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), not requiring immediate surgery.Indicated in pediatric and adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected.

1. Name:  Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  A 177Lu-labeled somatostatin analog peptide, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate belongs to an emerging form of treatments called Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), which involves targeting tumours with molecules carrying radioactive particles that bind to specific receptors expressed by the tumour. Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may also be referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate. Compared to the alternative somatostatin analogue DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide (dotatoc), Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate displays higher uptake of radioactivity in tumors and better residence times [1]. In terms of biodistribution, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate demonstrated a lower whole-body retention, indicating potentially lower risk for bone marrow toxicity [1]. The presence of a radioligand allows monitoring of treatment response post therapy and prior to next fraction of the dose delivery which may be clinically beneficial in estimating the intensity of lesion uptakes or deciding the dose for subsequent administrations [3].Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was approved by the FDA as Lutathera in January 2018 for intravenous injection. It is a first radiopharmaceutical agent to be approved for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and is indicated for adult patients with somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NETs [7]. Targeting pancreas and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the intestines and colon, neuroendocrine tumors may commonly metastasize to metastasize to the mesentery, peritoneum, and liver [2]. Patients with GEP-NETs have limited second-line treatment options after the metastasis of tumors and inadequate therapeutic response from first-line therapies. In a clinical trial involving patients with advanced somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NET, the treatment of Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in combination with octreotide resulted in longer progression-free survival compared to patients receiving octreotide alone and there was evidence of an overall survival benefit [2].
4. Indication:  Indicated for the treatment of somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), including foregut, midgut, and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults [FDA Label].

1. Name:  PYY3-36
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  PYY3-36 (Peptide YY) is a naturally occurring hormone that is believed to function as a physiologic inhibitor of food intake. PYY is released into the blood stream from specialized endocrine cells (L-cells) in the gut after a meal and is believed to trigger the feeling of satiety, or fullness. Because PYY is a peptide, initial studies focused on PYY delivery by injection. Utilizing its proprietary drug delivery technology, Nastech developed the nasal spray formulation of PYY as a unique, non-invasive treatment option for obesity.
