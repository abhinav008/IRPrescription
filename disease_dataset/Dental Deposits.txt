1. Name:  ATX-101
2. Groups:  Investigational
3. Description:  ATX-101 (medical), sodium deoxycholate for subcutaneous injection, is being evaluated as a treatment for the reduction of localized fat deposits. This includes treatment of superficial lipomas (benign tumors of soft tissue composed of mature fat cells), fat deposits in the submental region of the face/neck, and localized fat deposits in other parts of the body. Deoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring bile acid produced by the liver as one of several end products of cholesterol metabolism. As a naturally occurring component of the human body, deoxycholate is considered a ‘biocompatible’ detergent that solubilizes fat in the small intestine. ATX-101 demonstrates a relative selectivity for fat over other tissues.

1. Name:  Sea salt
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Sea salt is the salt obtained from the evaporation of seawater or water from saltwater lakes. Sea salt production is subject to little processing which leaves certain trace minerals and elements behind. In comparison, table salt is mined from underground sedimentary deposits and is more heavily processed to eliminate minerals. Unlike sea salt, table salt usually contains an additive to prevent clumping and involves addition of iodine. Sea salt is a food ingredient and is often colored by adding charcoal or red clay to sometimes be referred to as “Hawaiian Sea Salt.”

4. Indication:  Invert sugar presents a large variety of uses. It can be used therapeutically for parenteral hyperalimentation[6] or to be used as an excipient with a known effect.[10] Invert sugar is also approved for its use in food products as a humectant, crystallization modifier, and liquid and nutritive sweetener.[7]

In July 2013, Merck announced positive results for Phase Ib trials of Verubecestat. In the study, administration of Verubecestat at doses of 12, 40 and 60 mg resulted in a dose-dependent and sustained reduction in the levels of Ab40, a measure of BACE1 activity, in CSF from baseline of 57, 79 and 84 percent, respectively.

1. Name:  Calcium glycerophosphate
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Calcium glycerophosphate is a calcium salt of glycerophosphoric acid that forms a white, fine, slightly hygroscopic powder. The commercial product is a mixture of calcium beta-, and D-, and L -alpha-glycerophosphate. By FDA, calcium glycerophosphate is considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food ingredient as a nutrient supplement (source of calcium or phosphorus), or in food products such as gelatins, puddings, and fillings. It is also present in dental or oral hygiene products due to its cariostatic effects. It is suggested that calcium glycerophosphate promotes plaque-pH buffering, elevation of plaque calcium and phosphate levels and direct interaction with dental mineral [2].

1. Name:  Stannous fluoride
2. Groups:  Approved
3. Description:  Stannous Fluoride, or Tn(II) Fluoride, is a compound commonly used in toothpastes for the prevention of gingivitis, dental infections, cavities, and to relieve dental hypersensitivity. Although similar in function and activity to Sodium Fluoride (NaF), the conventionally added ingredient in toothpastes, stannous fluoride has been shown to be more effective at stopping and reversing dental lesions [2]. It manages and prevents dental caries and gingivitis by promoting enamel mineralization [1], reducing gingival inflammation and bleeding [3, 4] through its potential broad-spectrum antibiotic effect and modulation of the microbial composition of the dental biofilm [2]. It is an FDA-approved over-the-counter product.
4. Indication:  Indicated for use to relieve dental hypersensitivity, increase enamel production, prevent gingivitis and cavities, and control periodontal infections.
