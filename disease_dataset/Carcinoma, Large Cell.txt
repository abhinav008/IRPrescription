1. Name:  Sorafenib
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Sorafenib (rINN), marketed as Nexavar by Bayer, is a drug approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (primary kidney cancer). It has also received "Fast Track" designation by the FDA for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer), and has since performed well in Phase III trials.Sorafenib is a small molecular inhibitor of Raf kinase, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), VEGF receptor 2 & 3 kinases and c Kit the receptor for Stem cell factor. A growing number of drugs target most of these pathways. The originality of Sorafenib lays in its simultaneous targeting of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway.

1. Name:  Vinorelbine
2. Groups:  Approved, Investigational
3. Description:  Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [5]. It was initially approved in the USA in 1990's for the treatment of NSCLC [13].It is a third-generation vinca alkaloid. The introduction of third-generation drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with very similar results from the various drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in the combination treatment setting [2].A study was done on the clearance rate of vinorelbine on individuals with various single polymorphonuclear mutations. It was found that there was 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance across the cohort, suggesting a strong influence of genetics on the clearance of this drug [7].
4. Indication:  Vinorelbine tartrate is indicated for adults in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a single therapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs [5].Used in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, in combination with other chemotherapy agents [14].For the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis, in combination with methotrexate [14].For the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer [14].For the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer [14].For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, in patients previously treated with anthracyline and/or taxane therapy [14].For the treatment of HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, advanced breast cancer in patients previously treated with a taxane, in combination with trastuzumab and everolimus [14].
